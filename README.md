# BOJChecker
### Introduction

Parser for reading user profile from Baekjoon Online Judge.

You can read User Tier, Solved problem list from BOJ and solved.ac.

You can check whether users solved certain problems.

Developed for algorithm study.

Easy stuff, huh.



### Note

It uses urllib and bs4 (beautiful soup) libraries.

It would take some time to read data from web.
